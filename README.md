# Hi üëã, I'm Peng Miao (MMeowhite)
I explore the intersection of AI + life sciences, aiming to transform biomedical research with computational tools.
My work spans from deep learning for multi-omics, multi-modality to experimental cancer biology, and I love open-sourcing code & sharing knowledge.
